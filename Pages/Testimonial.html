						  <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Before I attended Asante I felt like my mind was fragile like it would take just one thing to break me. Then my grandma died and I was becoming numb to most things. Then going to Asante helped me purge all the feelings I had bottled up and made me confront all the other things I've been putting on pause because I did not have the mental strength to deal with any of it. It's still really hard but the difference now is I have the tools to help myself. When Im confronted by anything overwhelming I know how to approach it in a way that's healthy for me. I am recommending this programme to everyone. Nothing about your mental health journey is easy but this is the best first step to helping yourself.

						  <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Before I attended Asante I had no confidence and felt very horrible about myself. I had not cried and always had a negative view about my life. After I attended Asante I have a firm support structure where I feel free and safe to express my feelings. I am more confident and it made me realize the power of positive thinking. The universe gives you everything you need and I am learning to build myself up rather than break myself down. I even started writing again and when I do have a bad day I just put positive thoughts on paper. I used to go out and drink when I was feeling down and going through Asante I am realizing that I must first think of why I'm n how I got myself there. I am more happy and peaceful n I look forward to what the future has in store  for me. BEING SELFISH IS NOT A BAD THING. I know have gained friends in fact I have gained a family that's there for me for life and without Asante I don't think my light would shine from the inside out like it does right now. Thank you Sis Zandi for helping me find my inner peace and joy.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>

						  <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Asante was a very hard reset kind of experience. Definitely not for the faint of heart, with experiences that force you to feel and not think. I would recommend it to those who are stuck in their heads and minds so they get out and feel their souls and body too. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i>
